Developed a real-time health data processing system using Python and Apache Kafka,
where simulated wearable device data is generated and sent to five Kafka topics based on data type (heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels, activity, and sleep quality). 
A Kafka consumer module retrieves the data, processes it, and stores it in a relational database, with each topic mapped to a corresponding table.
Apache Kafka enables efficient message processing and seamless communication between producers and consumers.
